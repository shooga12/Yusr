# Yusr Application

Graduation Project

The proposed solution is to develop a Celiac disease application that provides different services that facilitate the daily lives of the patients. The patients will no longer have to look for multiple resources, and manually hunt for suitable products and restaurants, as the application will be their most reliable source! The applicationâ€™s users will be able to view a list of many verified gluten-free products, along with viewing and reviewing a list of the nearest bakeries, coffee shops, and restaurants. If users wish to go to supermarkets or double check the absence of gluten in certain products, they can do so by using the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) implemented in the application. The technology, based on Machine Learning (ML) and computer vision, will be able to recognize any gluten-containing ingredients to determine whether or not the food is safe for consumption.
